Research Project Summary: 

This research project devloped an inexpensive, non-mydriatic retinal imaging device combined with deep learning algorithms for broad-spectrum disease diagnosis. The aim is to create an accessible, accurate, and user-friendly tool for diagnosing a range of ophthalmic and neurodegenerative diseases by utilizing retinal biomarkers. The study involved building a non-mydriatic infrared fundus imaging device and integrating it with several deep learning models to analyze retinal images.

The research utilized a limited dataset, preprocessing techniques like Gaussian blur, grayscale, histogram equalization, and normalization to enhance model accuracy. Multiple deep learning architectures, including a multi-layer feedforward neural network and 3x3 Conv2D models, were evaluated. The optimized models demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, with the categorical classification model achieving an accuracy of 99.4% (overall efficacy rate of 0.9 - 0.95)

Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability of the models, showing a statistically significant improvement over traditional diagnostic methods. The study also emphasizes the potential of using retinal biomarkers for early detection and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Future work includes expanding datasets, refining deep learning models, integrating additional features for locating treatment centers, and enhancing the device's hardware and software for real-world application.
